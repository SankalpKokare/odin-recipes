    <h2>Discription</h2>
    <p>Misal is a Marathi word that means "mixture." The dish is a combination of different flavors and textures, with
        the spicy curry providing a contrast to the soft pav. The farsan adds a crunchiness, and the vegetables add a
        freshness.</p>

        dish that is perfect for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.</p>
