    <h2>Discription</h2>
    <p>Masala dosa is a popular South Indian dish made with a fermented lentil and rice batter that is cooked on a hot
        griddle to form a thin pancake. The pancake is then filled with a spicy potato curry and served with chutneys
        and sambar. </p>
    <p>The name "masala dosa" comes from the two main ingredients in the dish: the dosa (which is a type of pancake) and
        the masala (which is the spicy potato curry). The dosa is made by soaking lentils and rice in water overnight,
        then grinding them together with a little water to form a batter. The batter is then fermented for a few hours,
        which gives it a sour flavor.</p>
